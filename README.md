# Tic-Tac-Toe-game
Tic Tac Toe is a simple and engaging two-player game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a clean and responsive design with a dark blue theme, subtle hover effects, and a glowing click animation for a smooth and interactive user experience.

Players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid using X and O. The first player to align three marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game. A message displays the winner, and users can reset or start a new game with a single click.
